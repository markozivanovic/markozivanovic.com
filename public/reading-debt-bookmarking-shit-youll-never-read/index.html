            <p>Reading debt (also known as bookmark debt or Ctrl-D compulsion) is a concept in casual web browsing that reflects the implied cost of additional bookmark organization and undesirable future reading.</p>
<p>It’s caused by reckless pressing of Ctrl-D instead of using your brain for a moment to consider if you’ll ever want to read the damn thing later.</p>
<p>No, this isn’t an existent, known concept. I wrote it into its existence a few moments ago, following the sentence structure found on the Wikipedia page about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_debt" target="_blank">technical debt</a>.</p>
<p>It does however embody a sentiment of frustration that revolves around an unorganized mess created by hoarding and bookmarking material that will probably never be read.</p>

<p>This Friday afternoon, as I was adding yet another bookmark to the already overcrowded bookmark bar (filled with idiosyncratically named folders, the names of which are now reduced to mostly two-character acronyms, so more can fit), I decided I had enough and determined to do a general cleanup.</p>
<p>Just as a junk food addict would say, “This is my last burger before I go on a diet!” I said to myself, “This is my last recklessly created bookmark!”</p>
<h2 id="finding-the-solution">Finding the solution</h2>
<p>I remember I used <a href="https://getpocket.com/" target="_blank">Pocket</a> some years ago – before Mozilla acquired it, and before it changed its name (it was named “Read it Later” previously).</p>
<p>My research went that way – looking at the current state of Pocket and its alternatives, including <a href="https://pinboard.in/" target="_blank">Pinboard</a>, <a href="https://www.instapaper.com/" target="_blank">Instapaper</a>, and <a href="https://raindrop.io/" target="_blank">Raindrop</a>.</p>
<p>While I definitely understand how some people find value in these services, I realized they wouldn’t solve my problem. If anything, they would only make it worse – encouraging me to save more and more articles to read later, creating even more reading debt.</p>
<p>These services would help me organize the debt better, and they would undoubtedly display my hoarded treasure in a sexy way, but that’s not what I want. I want to get rid of (most of) it.</p>

<p>I ended up going to bed that night after failing to come up with a proper fix that’ll prevent me from ending up in the same situation two months from now – being overwhelmed by the amassed heap of hyperlinks I considered deserving of keeping at the time.</p>
<p>I kept the reading debt problem loop running in my mind for the next two days, albeit with a lower priority. What I came up with is a low-tech solution. So low tech, it consists of merely three questions I’ll ask myself every time before I want to save something to read later and a simple weekly reminder that will notify me to revise the status.</p>
<h2 id="this-is-the-algorithm">This is the algorithm:</h2>
<ol>
<li>Every time before you want to save something for later, ask yourself this:
<ol>
<li>Is this an advertisement or a puff piece?</li>
<li>Does this have a short expiry date, with no relevance to you, your family, or your job?</li>
<li>Do you need this for your future research/writing/development?</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>If the answer to the first two questions is <strong>no</strong>, and the answer to the last question is <strong>yes</strong>, bookmark the reading material.</li>
<li>Revise the status of the reading material weekly. If the article has not been read within a week, trash it. If you need it for further research, tag it and store it <strong>properly</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Only a week has passed since I incorporated this into my thinking process, but I can already say I recognize the benefits after the first revision.</p>
<p>Who knows, maybe it’s just me being more conscious and mindful about the problem, and the whole three-part process is unwarranted. Maybe the only reason I became more conscious and mindful is due to that three-part process.</p>
<p>It doesn’t matter. What matters is I’m on a good way to reduce my reading debt problem. If you have a better solution, I would love to hear about it!</p>
