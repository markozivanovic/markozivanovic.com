I was interviewing for a job recently, and I got asked what got me into coding. It's not the first time I got asked that same question, and it's one of my favorites. I love to see the person's reaction who asks me the question when I tell them the answer. 

It's the movie Hackers from 1995! I'm not joking. That's the movie that made me fall in love with computers, coding, and hacking.

Many people consider it cheesy, but I don't care. I watched it probably twenty times, if not more. I watch it any time I find myself feeling down and unmotivated. It reminds me of those first days, that initial spark. Just like you would reminisce about a beautiful beginning of a past love affair when you feel lonely and unloved.

I'm always on the lookout for some good hacking/coding fiction. It doesn't have to be fiction; it can even be a good documentary. The main point is to find something that I can read, watch or listen to that will motivate, inspire or excite me about my craft when I need a pick me up.

So, without further ado, here are some of my favorite movies and books that are part of my "My crime is that of curiosity" collection. Yep, I called it after the line in the essay called The Conscience of a Hacker. Of course, my favorite movie of all time references it. :)

**Disclaimer:** The last one is my shameless plug. It was my first attempt to collect my developer war stories and put them in a book form. I don't think it deserves to be listed with the greats, but this is my little blog, so I gave myself a pass! :)
