Hi, my name is Marko Živanović.

I’m a software developer currently living in [Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuttgart "Germany"). My focus nowadays is the web, but I love to tinker with electronics, learn new programming languages and platforms. I will try out anything tech-related I find interesting. 

With over twelve years of experience in IT, I’ve changed several technology stacks during that time. To mention all of it would be out of this scope, so I’ll leave it for a future entry (read: there’s a high chance it won’t happen). In my career, I worked both as an independent freelancer and a full-time employee for some pretty cool companies.

I take great interest in the impact of technology on society and politics. As a person who’s fascinated with ones and zeroes from an early age, I always liked to think about how we can make this world a better place through tech.

I enjoy reading books. I don’t limit myself to a specific topic. You can find on my bookshelf everything from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Brothers_Karamazov" target="_blank">classical literature</a> to modern works of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuromancer" target="_blank">fiction</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sapiens:_A_Brief_History_of_Humankind" target="_blank">non-fiction</a>, the latter being a more significant chunk of my collection. If I had to choose topics I spend most of the time reading about, other than technology, they would be history and sociology.

I'm pretty active on Twitter, so if you're interested in more frequent, albeit shorter updates about what I'm currently doing, you can follow me <a href="https://twitter.com/markozivan0vic" target="_blank">there</a>.

If you have a business proposition, a question, or want to get in touch for whatever reason, please contact me via email.
