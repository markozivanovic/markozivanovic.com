If you think that the average developer salary is 250k + stock options, you're reading too much Hacker News. That's not true.

If you think that you should have a perfect face without any pimples, and you should have an ass without any cellulite, relax. It's ok. Try to be as healthy as you can, but don't obsess about it.
